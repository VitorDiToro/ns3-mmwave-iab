# IAB feature for the ns-3 mmWave module #
Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is a 3GPP Study Item on the possibility of using the same network equipment and resources for both access and backhaul.

In this extension of the [ns-3 mmWave module](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave "ns-3 mmWave repo") that adds wireless relaying capabilities in an ns-3 NetDevice, and the possibility of simulating in-band relaying at mmWave frequencies. This extension has been developed by the University of Padova as part of a project with InterDigital Communications.

Please refer to [our paper](/ "IAB") for a complete description of the model.

## mmWave ns-3 module ##

This repository builds on the [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") mmWave module for the simulation of 5G mmWave cellular networks. A description of this module can be found on [IEEExplore (open access)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116/ "mmwave paper").
