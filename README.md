# IAB feature for the ns-3 mmWave module #
Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is a 3GPP Study Item on the possibility of using the same network equipment and resources for both access and backhaul.

In this extension of the [ns-3 mmWave module](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave "ns-3 mmWave repo") that adds wireless relaying capabilities in an ns-3 NetDevice, and the possibility of simulating in-band relaying at mmWave frequencies. 

Please refer to arXiv paper TODO for a description of the model.

## mmWave ns-3 module ##

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") mmWave module for the simulation
of 5G mmWave cellular networks. A description of this module can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02882 "mmwave paper").

The new-handover branch offers integration between LTE and mmWave and dual connectivity features.
