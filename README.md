# Code for the paper "Resource Management for 5G NR Integrated Access and Backhaul: a Semi-centralized Approach" #

This repository holds the code for the paper "Resource Management for 5G NR Integrated Access and Backhaul: a Semi-centralized Approach", which is available as a pre-print on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09938).
In particular, we hereby provide the ns-3 IAB module that we used, which is described in [our previous paper](/ "IAB") and on OCTAVE script, as empirical evidence of the optimality of the algorithm that we present.

## mmWave ns-3 module ##

This repository builds on the [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") mmWave module for the simulation of 5G mmWave cellular networks. A description of this module can be found on [IEEExplore (open access)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116/ "mmwave paper").

## Documentation and examples for ns-3 mmWave ##
